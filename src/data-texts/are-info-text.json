    "text": ["Welcome to Åre, a traditional mountain village where the wide range of skiing, shopping, restaurants and bars on offer are creating a real metropolitan vibe. The ski slopes and vistas are familiar from the many World Cup events that have been hosted here.", "Åre combines the vibe of a big city with that of a ski resort. The restaurants and shops are early adopters of new trends and many people from the Swedish capital frequently pop up to Åre during the winter season to escape the hassles of the big city and enjoy world class skiing while still having premium restaurants and shopping close by."]
