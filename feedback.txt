Good use of semantic elements

= = CSS = =
Good use of Flexbox
Good use of media queries
Good use of class-names instead of selecting by tagname.

= = React / JS = =
There is no need to call setState multiple times.
You can set multiple values at the same time like:
  setState({
    filterAir: "",
    filterAirChecked: true
  })

Good use of functional components when the component
only return jsx-elements and has no need for state.

Many complexed features has been created with 
an advanced usage of JavaScript. 
Very good job !!
